I"n<p>The developer community that collaborates on GitHub transcends languages, time zones, cultures, and more. As Hubbers, we are a daily reflection and extension of our global developer community.</p>

<p>In the past year, we grew by 30 percent, welcoming 360 new Hubbers from around the world. We increased the number of Hubbers who work outside of our San Francisco headquarters, either from a local office, coworking space, or more commonly, from home. Our focus on both hiring and retaining Hubbers from underrepresented backgrounds helped us maintain the overall representation of women and underrepresented minorities. Weâ€™re particularly conscious of an increase in the percentage of underrepresented minorities in technology and the percentage of women who are also underrepresented minorities. We have more to do, but we have a foundation to build on as we scale.</p>
