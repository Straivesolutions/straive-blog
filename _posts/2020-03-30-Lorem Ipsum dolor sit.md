Namaste! Today, we’re excited to announce GitHub India Private Limited, a subsidiary of GitHub, Inc. Our community in India is thriving, with the third-largest number of active developers on GitHub and 22 percent growth over the past year, adding to an already significant base. To better serve those developers and enterprise customers, we’re thrilled to bring GitHub closer by establishing a new GitHub subsidiary in India.

Maneesh Sharma, our newly appointed General Manager of GitHub India, will lead our growth strategy in the country. Over the next few months, we’re building a team across all functions—including community, engineering, sales, support, marketing, and services—to enable our customers to adopt DevOps best practices at scale and collaborate with over 40 million developers across more than 100 million projects.
