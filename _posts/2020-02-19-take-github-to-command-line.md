We’re introducing an easier and more seamless way to work with GitHub from the command line—GitHub CLI, now in beta. Millions of developers rely on GitHub to make building software more fun and collaborative, and gh brings the GitHub experience right to your terminal.

You can install GitHub CLI today on macOS, Windows, and Linux, and there’s more to come as we iterate on your feedback from the beta.
